## General Questions

- "How does the loan prediction model work?"
- "What are the different loan types available?"
- "Explain the three prediction outcomes"
- "What features does the model use?"
- "How accurate is the model?"
- "What is a TabTransformer?"

## Dataset & Data Questions (RAG-enabled)

- "What data is available in the dataset?"
- "Tell me about World Bank loan statistics"
- "What are the loan cancellation rates?"
- "What regions are covered in the data?"
- "How many loans are in the dataset?"
- "What is the average interest rate?"
- "Tell me about GDP data in the dataset"

## Model Explanation Questions

- "Explain why a loan might be predicted as Fully Disbursed"
- "What features are most important for predictions?"
- "How does interest rate affect loan outcomes?"
- "Why would a loan be cancelled?"
- "What factors lead to major cancellations?"
- "How does GDP affect loan outcomes?"
- "Explain the feature importance for my prediction"

## Usage Questions

- "How do I use the prediction tool?"
- "What information do I need to make a prediction?"
- "How do I interpret the prediction results?"
- "What does the confidence score mean?"
- "How do I export my prediction results?"

## Technical Questions

- "What is the model architecture?"
- "How was the model trained?"

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific**: Ask detailed questions for better answers
2. **Use context**: Mention your prediction results when asking for explanations
3. **Try different phrasings**: If one question doesn't work, rephrase it
4. **Combine questions**: Ask follow-up questions based on previous answers
